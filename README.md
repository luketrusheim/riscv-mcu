# RISC-V MCU with Set-Associative Cache and 5-stage Pipeline

RISC-V Otter MCU implemented on the Basys 3 Artix-7 FPGA board. This project involved the development of essential computer architecture modules, while following the RISC-V instruction set.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** SystemVerilog, Xilinx Vivado

This was a project that begin in a course at Cal Poly named "Computer Design and Assembly Language Programming" and carried over to the following course, "Computer Hardware Architecture and Design". Names could've been a bit more different, but it is what it is.

The intial version of this RISC-V processor was multicycle and capable of interrupts. Later on, it was changed to a 5-stage pipeline with a set-associative cache.
